## How to use:
Visit: http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~sxd7342/ISTE330/FitnessDatabaseWebApp
Then, pick a user from table in the "LoginInfo.PNG" file in the documentation folder to login with.
There are 3 types of users: Exercisers, Trainers, and Admin. Exercisers can view everything, but do
not have access to the "Admin" page. Trainers can do everything Exercisers can do, but they can only
view and modify exercise records on the "Admin" page that they wrote. Admin can create, edit, view, 
and delete all exercise, and user records on the "Admin" page. To logout, click the logout button
in the top right. Note that logged out users do not have access to the application.
